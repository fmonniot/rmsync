I hope you will like it.</p><p>Thanks to Blueowl, my wonderful beta.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Book I, Part III: The Shroud of the Dark Side</strong></p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Chapter 1<br></strong></p><p>The temple was one of the most imposing buildings on the urban planet of Coruscant. Many people throughout the Galaxy said that its height and structure was made to demonstrate the power of the Jedi order. People also had said that the Jedi had lost their connection to life in the Republic because they always kept to themselves and closed the order off from any outside influence. However, this view had changed profoundly after the Jedi Council had implemented fundamental changes to the rules of the order three years ago. To the astonishment of the Senate and the people throughout the Galaxy, the order had begun to open up. Since these changes had been made, more and more bonded Jedi were seen and Jedi children were born in the temple. For everyone outside the order, the Jedi had suddenly changed from supernatural beings into normal people, who experienced joy and happiness or pain and suffering like every other Republic citizen. Suddenly, the temple was no longer that imposing because the order lost some of the former mystery around it.</p><p>Approaching it from space was still impressive and Obi-Wan Kenobi heaved a sigh of contentment at seeing his home. His last mission had taken its toll on him and he was relieved that the Council had told him that they wanted him to stay at the temple for a longer time. It was time to catch up with Bant and Garen, Qui-Gon and Tahl, and, above all, he was longing to spend time with Anakin, who was now at the age of twelve and would have to find a Master soon. He had missed them all while being constantly on missions not able to have more than a day or two in the temple.</p><p>His heart pounded in his chest when the ship landed on the temple's hangar. There were people waiting for him and Obi-Wan was able to determine their Force-Signatures. He felt Qui-Gon and Anakin, as well as Mace and Master Yoda and he was looking forward to greeting them personally. Trying to keep his serene Jedi composure, he stepped out the ship and was met with the arms of the boy he loved so much. Laughing, he closed his arms around him and was hugged tightly.</p><p>"You're back," the boy said with overwhelming joy in his voice. "I thought you'd never come home."</p><p>"Anakin, you know that I will always return to you," Obi-Wan responded and felt a lump forming in his throat. This time he had sometimes thought that he wouldn't be able to keep that promise. He had experienced many life-threatening situations on this mission and if it hadn't been for his experience in his former life he didn't know if he would have been able to get through them as he had.</p><p>Looking up, he saw Qui-Gon smiling broadly at the reunion while Master Yoda and Mace were trying to maintain their composure as it was demanded of Masters of the Jedi Council. Obi-Wan smiled and freed himself out of Anakin's grip.</p><p>"Let me greet them properly, Anakin. We're going to have time later."</p><p>Nodding, the boy turned around and they walked toward the greeting committee.</p><p>"Obi-Wan," Qui-Gon said and hugged his former apprentice shortly. "I'm happy to have you back."</p><p>"As am I, Master, believe me," the younger man responded and turned toward the Council Masters bowing shortly. He was their equal and an acknowledgment of their joined position was enough between them.</p><p>Mace reached out his hand to shake Obi-Wan's. "We are really happy that you made it out of there alive, Obi-Wan."</p><p>"Difficult mission this had been. Good it is that returned you have," Master Yoda said and his ears lifted up as an indication of his joy.</p><p>"It really was difficult this time, Masters," Obi-Wan confirmed. "However, I've managed to settle a peace treaty with both parties and we've got nothing to worry about anymore."</p><p>"As you always do, Obi-Wan. The order hasn't got a more capable negotiator than you," Mace said and winked.</p><p>Obi-Wan blushed a bit at the praise. Even two and a half years of being in the Council hadn't changed his attitude. He was still modest and that was something all his fellow Jedi loved about him.</p><p>Anakin was fidgeting impatiently at Obi-Wan's side and Qui-Gon had to laugh at seeing the boy. "I think Anakin wants you to come with him to our quarters, Obi-Wan. He has a surprise for you waiting there."</p><p>"We don't want to hold you up, Obi-Wan," Mace said with a smile toward the boy. "Council briefing will be tomorrow. Master Yoda and I would like to see you in the evening though to fill you in."</p><p>Obi-Wan nodded. "I will be there, Mace." And without having the time to say another word, he was led away by Anakin. Smiling apologetically to the two Council Masters, he followed the eager boy.</p><p>"You will see, Obi-Wan. My present for you is just wizard. Luan and I did work on it together."</p><p>Obi-Wan looked questioningly at his former Master who returned nothing more than a knowing smile. "Did he tamper with droids again, Qui?" the young Master asked, rolling his eyes.</p><p>"I won't tell," Qui-Gon replied and looked to the boy with a wink.</p><p>When they entered Qui-Gon's quarters, Tahl was sitting in the common room together with Luan. The girl still hadn't talked about her origin but, apart from that, she had recovered nicely. After one year, the Council had decided that she should participate in daily education but remain with Qui-Gon and Tahl. Both had been happy about that because they had become used to her presence in their life. At that time, the Council had also decided that children of bonded Jedi were to remain with their parents until a Master would choose them as Padawan. The Jedi were on their way to become a family order and Obi-Wan was glad about it. It had allowed Anakin to have constant contact with his own family on Naboo and many other younglings had been granted the same. If someone had told Obi-Wan a few years ago that this would happen, he would have denied it. However, even Mace had come around and seemed to be enjoying the growing Jedi community in the temple.</p><p>In comparison to Anakin, who tended to be enthusiastic and impulsive, Luan was still a serious and thoughtful child. She was more of the shy type and still had her problems to relate to people she didn't know well. Unfortunately, Obi-Wan was one of these people. She hadn't seen much of him over the last years and when he had been around she always needed time to get used to him. But Tahl always told him how much Luan adored him from afar even if she didn't speak more than a few sentences with him when he was around.</p><p>When Obi-Wan entered the common room with Anakin and Qui-Gon, Luan looked up at them and Obi-Wan saw her blushing. Tahl stood up to greet the young Master and Luan was hiding behind her.</p><p>"Obi-Wan, it's so nice that you're finally back," Tahl said and shoved Luan gently in front of her. "Say hello to Obi-Wan, sweetie."</p><p>The girl looked into Obi-Wan's eyes and the Jedi Master was stunned that she seemed to have grown even more beautiful than the last time he had seen her. With her nine years, the features of the woman she would become were already visible. Her brown eyes wore an understanding expression which astonished him as it was unusual for a girl of her age. The Force was immensely strong in her. Like Qui-Gon, she had a strong connection to the Living Force and this was one of the reasons why she understood things going on around her without asking.</p><p>She could barely look at him when she said, "Hello, Master Obi-Wan."</p><p>He took her tiny hand and knelt down to get to her eye level. Placing his hand on her shoulder, he replied, "You don't have to call me Master, Luan. I am still Obi-Wan to you."</p><p>As every time when he had been away for a long time, she smiled shyly and nodded. It would take a few days for her to become accustomed to his presence but he knew that she would come around eventually.</p><p>Anakin was getting impatient now. "Obi-Wan, we have that present for you…," he said and took the young Master's hand to lead him away. Obi-Wan stood up, taking Luan in his other hand. "Well, then let's see what you've got."</p><p>They entered Luan's quarters and Obi-Wan looked stunned toward an astrodroid. Anakin moved to it and pushed a button to switch it on. The droid began to beep and the boy looked at Obi-Wan expectantly.</p><p>"We've built you your own astrodroid. His name is R4 and we exchanged R2D2's plans with Padme to make him as effective as R2 is. You can take him with you on missions. And…" Anakin was barely able to catch a breath before continuing. "We've programmed R2 and R4 to communicate with each other, so that you'll have a constant connection with Padme if you want."</p><p>Beaming with pride, Anakin was waiting for Obi-Wan's reaction. The young Master was speechless though. He had already feared that Anakin had tampered with droids to make him a present, but he never would have thought that the boy would give him something this special. It was a well thought-out present for someone like him, who was constantly on missions and in need of a reliable astrodroid.</p><p>Qui-Gon had entered behind them and was now smiling at his former apprentice. "They really made an effort to please you this time, don't you think?"</p><p>Obi-Wan nodded, overwhelmed. "You really did, Anakin, Luan. That's a great surprise."</p><p>Qui-Gon's smile changed into a mischievous grin when he said, "And that they had the idea of programming a connection with R2..."</p><p>Obi-Wan threw him an exasperated glance back. "Don't start it again, Qui..." It was a permanent argument between them. Qui-Gon always tried to convince Obi-Wan that the Queen of Naboo had more than friendship in mind when it came to him.</p><p>While Obi-Wan was content to see the rule of attachment being lifted, allowing Jedi to bond and live a relationship, it wasn't a concept he could imagine for himself. Too long had he lived by the non-attachment rule to change his own notion about it. It never occurred to him that the changes he had evoked in the Jedi order could concern him and his life. Tahl and Qui-Gon had often discussed this issue with him during the last years. He had to admit that he loved the family life these two, as well as Anakin and Luan, provided him. However, having this family was enough for him. He couldn't even think about starting one on his own. In his opinion, he had nothing to offer to a probable wife. He knew that the Force had sent him back for a purpose and this purpose would mean he had to make sacrifices. He didn't want to burden a family with this. Padme was nothing more than a dear friend to him and he wished Qui-Gon would cease his teasing about it.</p><p>"We made R4 for you because you need someone to take care of you when you are alone," Luan interrupted his musings.</p><p>Obi-Wan swallowed deeply at seeing the honest expression in the girl's eyes. "That's... uhm … Thank you so much, Luan," he stuttered and hugged her, kissing her cheek. "I need someone to take care of me, when all of you aren't around," he whispered in her ear, getting a broad smile in response.</p><p>Anakin was fidgeting again. He wanted to show Obi-Wan the technical things they had implemented in the little astrodroid. Laughing about the boy's enthusiasm, the young Master knelt down beside him and R4, listening carefully, asking questions if needed and giving praise to Anakin and Luan for thinking about everything.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Every time the Sith Lord was angry, the people in his household at the end of the Galaxy on Zigoola feared that he would unleash his fury on one of them. He had done so often enough. One would think that such a behavior would drive all the servants away but that wasn't the case. Too high was the price to be paid when someone of the entourage would leave. Sidious had all of them firmly in his grip. There were the ones who had reason enough to fear the Lord's knowledge about them and there were others who admired Sidious for his strength and the promise that one day they would rule the Galaxy at his side. Some of them were both. All of them hoped for a position which allowed them to command others. However, they all knew that no one was closer to their Lord than Darth Tyrannus, his apprentice. Even if Sidious wasn't around, everyone paid Tyrannus respect, knowing well which impact his success or failure had on the Dark Lord's mood.</p><p>They now bowed to him as he left his starship with confident steps, his dark cape disguising most of his figure. Dooku didn't even pay them a bit of attention. He finally had found part of what his Master desired and he was hurrying to share his knowledge with the Lord. He just had to hope that it would be enough to satisfy Sidious. It wasn't that he feared the Sith's punishments, he already had become used to the permanent pain in his life. He had crossed that line long ago and accepted that his soul wouldn't be saved from the Dark. However, there was still a part in him that firmly remained in the light. A part he protected from the dark tendrils which had overtaken his mind. It was this part he didn't want Sidious to find, the part which hid his knowledge about Obi-Wan Kenobi. He knew that it was also the part of his mind Sidous desired even more than what he held in his hands now. However, he wouldn't have it. Dooku kept to his promise to serve the Dark Lord, he had even found a certain pleasure in the Dark. It came to him naturally now. But he wouldn't give up this last part, not only to protect the young man he had come to respect but also to protect himself. If Sidious knew the truth about Obi-Wan Kenobi, he wouldn't value Dooku as his apprentice any longer. He would begin a hunt for Kenobi's soul and in the process Dooku would lose his power over the Lord. A power he held now because Sidious needed him to do the dirty work.</p><p>Dooku smiled triumphantly when he looked to the door separating him from his Master. Sidious would be thrilled about what he had for him. They had gained an advantage and they would use it.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"What happened?"Obi-Wan was asking his friend Mace when he entered his office.</p><p>Mace responded with a worrisome glance. "What tells you that something happened?" He knew he couldn't fool the young Master but it still amazed him how perceptive Obi-Wan was.</p><p>"Well, you told me that you needed me here on Coruscant, which means you have a situation here that requires my presence. Don't tell me you've been worried about my health."</p><p>"Honestly, I am worried about your health, Obi-Wan," Mace responded with an indignant expression. "However, you are right as you always are. We need to talk and the Council has to decide how to proceed with the situation. I didn't want to decide that without you being here."</p><p>"Then tell me, Mace," Obi-Wan replied and sat down on the chair opposite of the Korun-Master.</p><p>"We've received a message from Garen Muln a few days ago," Mace began and pushed the button of his holoprojector. Instantly, the blue shimmering form of Garen appeared.</p><p>"I've found another part of the prophesy, Master Windu. However, I wasn't able to secure it before the Sith got it."</p><p>Obi-Wan looked up questioningly and Mace stopped the transmission. "Garen told us a few months ago that he'd been followed. He was convinced that it was a Sith as he was able to sense the dark signature. Until now, we haven't had a clue about his identity."</p><p>"It must be the apprentice Sidious told me about," Obi-Wan stated and his eyes closed briefly at the remembrance of his encounter with the Dark Lord. Since Master Yoda had placed the block, Sidious hadn't been able to reach him again and Obi-Wan was glad about that. However, this fact had also prevented him from getting to know the identity of the new Sith apprentice.</p><p>"Well, Garen has seen him," Mace continued, "And you won't like what he has to tell." He pushed the button again to continue the transmission.</p><p>"I saw him, Master Windu, and I am pretty sure that it was Master Dooku. I wasn't able to talk or even fight him because the moment I entered the house of my informant, he just disappeared. But I saw his figure when he left and... uhm... I don't know Master Dooku's signature that well, but it felt like him, only like a much darker version of him. My informant didn't survive this encounter. He was killed by Force lightning. I can't believe that Master Dooku turned but all the evidence is telling me that it is true."</p><p>Once more, Mace stopped the transmission. Obi-Wan's face had gone as white as a sheet at the news. Who could blame him? Dooku knew almost everything about his history. If he was a Sith, Sidious must have knowledge about Obi-Wan's key role to the order by now.</p><p>"How?" Obi-Wan asked when he had processed the information sufficiently to deal with it.</p><p>Mace shook his head. "I don't know. Perhaps Sidious promised him something during the fight on Naboo? He must have gone with him deliberately, otherwise we would have gotten an emergency call. In any case, the Sith wouldn't have been able to cloud both of their Force signatures that effectively if he hadn't volunteered."</p><p>"He could have used a Force inhibitor," Obi-Wan countered. He wanted to deny what lay openly before him. He had trusted Dooku this time. It had taken its time but he had come to value the older Master's views and opinions. He wasn't ready to believe that this Jedi had once more betrayed them.</p><p>"You know that we would have felt a trace of his signature then, Obi-Wan. No, Dooku has left with the Sith, Force knows why he did it, but he did."</p><p>Obi-Wan nodded. There was no point in denying it. "Well," he said and took a deep breath. "At least I know our adversary good enough in this case. We have to talk with Supreme Chancellor Valorum about it. It won't take long until Dooku will play a political role as leader of the opposition. We have to prevent them from leaving the Republic this time."</p><p>"That's why I wanted you here, Obi-Wan. Your skill in dealing with politicians and your knowledge of the future is an asset in this situation."</p><p>The young Master sighed. "Not that I like it. . . ." Then he nodded, having an idea. "In the last days of the old Republic, an alliance had been formed against Palpatine. It had been too late then but the Senators, who had formed it, had been trustworthy enough to keep to the principles of democracy after the fall of the Republic. Perhaps this time they could play a more important role. We could try to form an alliance with them now. It should help us to deal with the political side of this conflict."</p><p>"Why haven't the Jedi worked with them then?" Mace asked as it seemed the logical thing to do for him.</p><p>"Palpatine already had succeeded in planting mistrust. There were only two Senators of the group who supported including the Jedi in their plans. So, they decided against it."</p><p>Mace raised his eyebrow. "We should talk to these two then."</p><p>Obi-Wan smiled. "One of them had been Padme Amidala, who is now Queen of Naboo instead of a Senator. However, I have good relations with Kael Dorvin, the Senator of Naboo who seems to be rational enough to follow our case. The other was the one who saved Master Yoda and me after Order sixty-six. I don't even know if he is a Senator by now. His name is Bail Organa and he comes from Alderaan."</p><p>Mace typed the name into the datapad before him. "Here he is. Bail Organa, the young viceroy of Alderaan. I am impressed, Obi-Wan, this should be a powerful ally. He is very young to have such an important role on his planet. He isn't Senator yet, but he aids Senator Antilles from Alderaan which means he has enough influence. However, there is no connection between the Jedi and him until now."</p><p>"Well, Kael could arrange that. They should be around the same age and it wouldn't be too difficult to find a reason for them to meet."</p><p>"And what are we going to tell them?"</p><p>"I think, we should tell them that there is a threat to the Republic and that the Jedi can't fight it in the political arena; that we should work together in this, exchanging information, looking out for signs of a Separatist movement."</p><p>Mace shook his head thoughtfully. "That means, we have to tell them about the Sith. I don't like that. We don't know how they're going to deal with it."</p><p>"Well, Kael Dorvin already knows about them after having fought on Naboo. And Bail Organa, he will be glad that the Jedi are honest with him. Last time, he was very angry when he found out about the Sith and the fact that the Jedi had kept it to themselves. Anyway, we have to take the risk, Mace. We need allies in the Senate. Dooku doesn't keep to the battlefield in this fight. We can't let him do what he did in my former life."</p><p>Mace nodded. "So, be it then. We're going to talk about it with the Council. A political alliance against the Sith can only help things."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>When Qui-Gon entered Obi-Wan's quarters that evening, he felt the well-known signature of his former Padawan on the balcony. Every time when Obi-Wan stayed on Coruscant, the young Master enjoyed his friends' visits. They had made it a habit to talk to each other in the evenings after Qui-Gon had brought Luan to bed. Today was no exception and Qui-Gon had been looking forward to this for a long time. Obi-Wan had been on missions for five months without returning to the temple and they had a lot to catch up on.</p><p>He stepped out and approached the young man. Obi-Wan was looking to the stars and his gaze was distant. Qui-Gon could tell that he was deep in thoughts and stopped midway to not disturb him. Had Obi-Wan even felt him entering the quarters? He shouldn't have even doubted it because in that moment the young Master turned around and smiled.</p><p>"Well, did you think you could sneak up on me that easily?" he asked with a wink.</p><p>Qui-Gon shook his head. "Not really. But you were far away with your thoughts. Will you share with me what bothers you?"</p><p>Obi-Wan shrugged in response. "Well, I'd say you'd be better not knowing it but you wouldn't accept that. So, let's sit down in the common room and talk. It's a bit chilly out here."</p><p>The older Master knew that something had to be wrong. He could sense it in the Force but he could also see it in Obi-Wan's gestures. The young man was sitting down on a chair and stroked his beard thoughtfully.</p><p>"You only do that if you're thinking how to tell me something I won't like," Qui-Gon stated and sat down on the couch, looking toward Obi-Wan expectantly.</p><p>"Hm, you really know me well, Qui," Obi-Wan replied and took a deep breath. "Dooku lives," he said and looked up, waiting for his former Master's reaction.</p><p>Qui-Gon inhaled sharply. Did he just say that the Master whose death he had mourned for over two years lived? "It... That... I mean, this can't be true," he stuttered in response. "We would have felt him."</p><p>Obi-Wan shook his head. "I'm sorry, Qui. Dooku must have turned on Naboo. Garen saw and felt him. He is the Sith apprentice Sidious told me about."</p><p>Disbelief was the first thing that entered Qui-Gon's mind. His former Master wouldn't turn to the Dark side, he just wouldn't, would he? The truth began to sink in slowly. His connection with the Living Force was already telling him that Obi-Wan was right. The young man wouldn't tell him such an incredulous thing if he had no proof.</p><p>"He turned? Again?" was the only thing he was able to mutter and received a nod of assent from Obi-Wan in return.</p><p>"Why?" Qui-Gon asked and stood up, beginning to pace.</p><p>"We don't know, Qui. We just know that he is a Sith now. He must have left with Sidious back then on Naboo. That's why we haven't found his corpse. And we are convinced that he went with the Dark Lord on his own will."</p><p>Once more, Qui-Gon reached out into the Force and felt the young man's words confirmed. Dooku had decided to turn. However, the Force was silent about the reasons. He shook himself; he couldn't dwell on the why. He needed to focus on what to do with this knowledge.</p><p>"What does this mean? Will the story repeat itself?" he asked and looked to his thoughtful former Padawan, who shook his head at the question.</p><p>"We shouldn't rely on my knowledge of the future alone. However, we know about Master Dooku's strengths and I am sure that Sidious is going to exploit them."</p><p>"I assume, he will make him his public face then," Qui-Gon concluded. "In comparison to Darth Maul, Dooku has charisma and the ability to lead people. He could play a role in dividing the Republic again, couldn't he?"</p><p>"I am convinced about that, Qui. It won't be as easy as the last time. Sidious had been Supreme Chancellor then. But I'm sure the Dark Lord will find another way to plant mistrust. We have to observe the Senate closely."</p><p>"Will the Council take measures to deal with it?" Qui-Gon asked and Obi Wan nodded.</p><p>"We will talk about it in our session tomorrow. We have an advantage because of my knowledge. However, Dooku knows that and he surely has told Sidious about my true identity."</p><p>Qui-Gon shook his head. "I can't believe that. How could we trust him like that? We shouldn't have told him. . . ."</p><p>Obi-Wan interrupted him. "We couldn't know. Everything has a reason. I remember that it was you who told me to trust in the Force."</p><p>Qui-Gon had to smile at that. "Well, there is a reason why you, my Padawan, are in the Council and I am not. It never ceases to amaze me how well I must have taught you."</p><p>Obi-Wan blushed a bit at the praise. "Well, talking about teaching. How is Luan doing in her mastery of the Force? She should have learned a thing or two since I last saw her."</p><p>Qui-Gon knew that Obi-Wan wanted to change the subject for a reason. He often told him about things which concerned the Council but he never tried to discuss things further than the Council already had done. His former Padawan always respected the rules that came with his position. He decided to play along. Being honest with himself, he preferred to think this news through on his own before elaborating it further with Obi-Wan.</p><p>"She is very strong in the Living Force. That's why she is able to sense almost everything that's going on. It is a bit overwhelming for her being together with her age-mates, who aren't advanced in shielding themselves yet. I taught her shielding techniques to protect her mind and as she has formed a deep friendship with Anakin, I also taught him to shield himself better. They are very fond of each other. Even if we kept attention that they are not aware of their high Midichlorian count, they seem to sense that their lives are somehow linked."</p><p>Obi-Wan smiled, satisfied at what Qui-Gon told him. "You know, the Anakin in my life didn't have any friends of his age or younger. I loved seeing them today. They seem to play with each other as children should."</p><p>Qui-Gon laughed. "They do and sometimes they get a bit too enthusiastic. Ask Mace about the kitchen droids. They have found a liking in tampering with them. The only thing I could do to distract them was giving them R4. Isn't it amazing what they have done with it?"</p><p>Obi-Wan gave a broad smile. "I am looking forward seeing this little astrodroid in action."</p><p>"You should begin with its connection to a certain other droid on Naboo," Qui-Gon replied with a wink.</p><p>"I surely will call Padme soon, my Master. But that's no reason for you to speculate again. We are just friends and you know that. I wish you would stop that."</p><p>Qui-Gon heard the little annoyance and asked himself why Obi-Wan was so persistent in denying his own feelings for Padme. They had argued about that often during the last years. The only conclusion for the young man's behavior was that he still wasn't aware of the bond Qui-Gon had felt from the beginning.</p><p>"Now, tell me, how is your life as bonded Jedi," Obi-Wan asked and Qui-Gon knew he wouldn't be able to return to the subject of the young Queen as long as Obi-wan didn't want to speak about it.</p><p>They continued their evening chatting about everything Obi-Wan had missed during his absence. Qui-Gon was able to give the young man a report about Shmi's well-being on Naboo and the rumors that were spreading more and more about Master Gallia being in love with Mace Windu. Obi-Wan laughed heartily at that, knowing well enough that Mace wouldn't even consider a relationship. Although the Korun-Master had made his peace with the new policy of attachment, Obi-Wan wasn't able to imagine him crossing the line himself. Qui-Gon shortly thought that the Council-Master and Obi-Wan had that in common but didn't mention it. He wanted to have an evening without arguing with the young man and was relieved that despite their knowledge about Dooku, they were able to enjoy being together like this.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"It's still not the complete text, my Lord, but it's a step. The prophesy not only refers to the son of the two suns but also to a daughter of a moon." Dooku was sitting together with his Sith Master in the control room. From here, Sidious could survey the entire planet and was also able to contact his spies throughout the Galaxy.</p><p>The Dark Lord scrutinized the text before him and concentrated on its meaning. "Tell me, Darth Tyrannus, who is that son of the suns? Has he already been at the temple when you left?"</p><p>Dooku swallowed a bit before looking up at his Master. He wouldn't tell him about his own theory. This was part of what he kept to himself.</p><p>"Well, Master, I haven't been to the temple for a long time then, being sent to an undercover mission and all. I don't know if the Jedi have already found their Chosen One. And one thing is sure, they don't even have the knowledge to look out for this daughter of a moon."</p><p>Sidious shook his head thoughtfully. "Well, it could be Kenobi. Do you know where he came from?"</p><p>"It wasn't part of my duties to know the younglings' background, My Lord. I don't know anything about it," Dooku replied with a firm voice.</p><p>"What does this mean anyway? ... <em>And in the time of greatest despair, there shall come a savior, and he shall be known as the son of the suns. He shall find his power in the daughter of a moon but only … </em>What comes after the only?"</p><p>Dooku shook his head. "I don't know, Master. We have to look out for the rest. Allow me to continue my search. I am sure I will find it."</p><p>Sidious nodded. "You shall be granted that permission soon. But before you continue that mission, I want you to go to Kamino."</p><p>Dooku listened to his Master's instructions and his eyes widened at the impact of the plan. When Sidious had ended, he bowed and said, "I will do as you wish, my Lord."</p>
