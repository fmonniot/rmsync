There are quite a bit of awesome people who did the required reverse engineering for us. Here are some references I used while building this crate:

- Archive file format: https://remarkablewiki.com/tech/filesystem#metadata_file_format (the wiki as a whole is a gold mine)
- Auth/Storage explanation: https://github.com/splitbrain/ReMarkableAPI/wiki/Storage
- A relatively straight forward implemenation of the API (and more) in Go: https://github.com/juruen/rmapi
